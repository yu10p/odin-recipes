    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This classic bubble tea drink, originating from Taiwan, is one of my favorite summer drink recipes. It's
        refreshing and energizing and packs a caffeine punch. This homemade boba milk tea recipe, inspired by my strolls
        in Taiwan, is super simple. I make it with condensed milk, which blends perfectly with strong black tea. Some
        street vendors opt for whole milk, which offers an equally authentic taste of Taiwanese boba milk tea for those
        not fond of condensed milk. For a less sweet option, adjust the amount of brown sugar syrup or condensed milk.
        No muscovado sugar? Don't fret. Brown sugar works just as well!

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the boba pearls: Add the water and muscovado sugar to a medium pan over medium-high heat. Cook until
            the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil, 3–4 minutes. Add a bit of the tapioca flour and cook,
            stirring constantly, until smooth. Add half of the remaining tapioca flour and stir vigorously until a
            sticky dough forms. Turn off the heat and add the remaining tapioca flour. Stir until the dough comes
            together in a ball (not all of the flour will be incorporated at this stage). Let cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a clean surface. Knead until all of the flour is incorporated and the dough is
            smooth, adding more flour or water as needed if the dough is too sticky or too dry.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 2 portions. Roll the dough into long, thin ropes about ¼-inch (6.35 mm) thick, cutting
            in half crosswise if they get too long. Cut the ropes into ¼-inch (6.35 mm) pieces. Roll each piece into a
            ball and place in a bowl with a bit of tapioca flour. Dust the balls with the flour to prevent them from
            sticking to each other.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Shake off any excess flour from the tapioca pearls, then add to the
            boiling water. Stir to separate the pearls, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring
            occasionally, for about 20 minutes, until cooked through.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the brown sugar syrup: Add the muscovado sugar and water to a small saucepan over medium
            heat. Cook until the sugar dissolves and the syrup reduces slightly, 5–7 minutes. Pour the syrup into a
            large heatproof bowl.</li>
        <li>Once the pearls have cooked through, drain and rinse with cold water. Add the pearls to the bowl with the
            brown sugar syrup and let sit for 30–60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the black tea: In a medium pot over high heat, combine the water and tea bags. Bring to a boil, then
            remove the pan from the heat and let the tea cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Make the milk mixture: In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the half-and-half and
            sweetened condensed milk until combined.</li>
        <li>Assemble the boba milk tea: Add about ⅓ cup (80 ml) boba pearls and brown sugar syrup to the bottom of each
            glass. Top with 1½ cups (225 grams) ice, then add ½ cup (240 ml) black tea and 3 tablespoons of the milk
            mixture. Stir with a wide-opening straw, then serve.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
